MkDocs hook: render GitHub alert callouts as Material admonitions.

The handbook is written to read well in two places: on GitHub, where
`> [!NOTE]` blockquotes render as coloured callouts natively, and on the
MkDocs site. Material does not understand GitHub's syntax — it wants
`!!! note` — so without this hook every callout renders as a plain
blockquote with a literal "[!NOTE]" as its first line.

Rather than switching the sources to Material syntax (which would break
the GitHub rendering the READMEs and direct file views rely on), rewrite
the blockquotes into admonitions at build time.

Fenced code inside a callout is preserved: the whole body is indented by
four spaces, which is how Material nests fences inside admonitions.
